# software-testing

A repo for the testing assignments for the course Software Testing (Master Computer Science 2001WETSWT) at the University of Antwerp in the academic year of 2024-2025. This is a group project, the members are Niels Van der Planken and Thomas Gueutal.

These projects make use of the JPacman-Framework project, provided to us by the teaching assistants as a zip-file of the source code. The original repo may be found [here](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/jpacman-framework).
